## Objective and Inspiration:
As part of my Software Engineering Immersive cohort with General Assembly, we were asked to create a browser-based game for our Unit 1 Project. I have been a fan of the simplicity of the card game War since I was a child, but decided I wanted to try to add my own flair to the common gameplay loop. I had just finished the first three books of Brandon Sanderson's _The Stormlight Archive_ before starting the cohort, and knew immediately what my theme would be. A back and forth battle, where soldiers "lost" would be removed from the game completely and placed into a points counter, making the importance of every battle that much higher.
